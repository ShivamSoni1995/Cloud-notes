INTERNET and WEB SERVER
-Nginx is an open source web server often used as reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache
-Web server is a computer that hosts and delivers web pages to users over HTTP/HTTPS
-Reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers, intercepting client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend server, enhancing security, performance, and reliability. It increases security, enhances performance and improves reliability by load balancing.



SWITCH
-It facilitates the communication between host in the same network
-It is an L2 device hence focuses on only the L2 header which consists of the MAC address
-They use and maintain MAC address table which has the switch ports connected with different hosts MAC
-They perform 3 action, learn, flood and forward
-Learn-It updates table with switch port and source MAC address
-Flood- It duplicates data frame and sends it out of all ports and only the recipient host will accept the data as it corresponds with the correct MAC address
-Forward- As data keeps passing the switch keeps updating the MAC address table

-Broadcast is a data frame where data is to be delivered to all the hosts on the same network, it has FFFF.FFFF.FFFF as destination mac addres

Broadcast frame vs unicast frame. 
-Broadcast frames are always flooded and are not initiated by the switch
-Unicast frames are occasionally flooded by the switch when the source MAC address in not available in the MAC table

VLAN-virtual local area network
-It divides the switch in independent isolated groups
-It allows switch to perform learn, flood and forward functions in isolated vlans
-Same learn, flood and forward operations will be performed when data passes through multiple switches



ROUTERS
-routers have their own ip and mac address
-they facilitate data transfer between different networks

NETWORKING PROTOCOLS
-It is a set of rules and messages that from an internet standard
ARP-address resolution protocol
FTP- File transfer protocol
SMTP- Simple mail transfer protocol
HTTP-Hyper text transfer protocol, to exchange html
SSL-Secure sockets layer
TLS-Transport layer security
HTTPS- HTTP secured by SSL/TLS tunnel
DNS- Domain name system converts the domain name, mail address into ip address. When you make a request for a website, the host first connects with the DMS server to get the ip address from the domain name, then connect with the concerned ip address website.

Any host requires 4 elements for internet connectivity
-IP address of the host
-Subnet Mask- to define the size of the local network
-Default gateway(router ip address)
-DNS server IP address

DHCP-Dynamic host configuration protocol. The DHCP server provides all the above 4 elements when a host is connected to a new network



VPC-Virtual Private Cloud
-It is a logically isolated part of a public cloud in which one can launch and manage resources like VM, databases and storage.
Its features are
-Isolation
-Subnets
-Routing and gateways
-Security
-Elasticity

Subnetting- It involves dividing the VPC's IP address into smaller, more manageable segments called subnets
-Subnet mask: is a 32-bit number that is used in conjunction with an IP address to divide a network into subnetworks (subnets). It helps determine which portion of the IP address refers to the network and which portion refers to the host (the individual device within that network).
IP Address Structure: An IP address is made up of four octets (or bytes), each containing 8 bits, totaling 32 bits (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
Subnet Mask Structure: Like an IP address, a subnet mask is also made up of four octets (e.g., 255.255.255.0).
The 1 bits in the subnet mask correspond to the network portion of the IP address i.e: in 192.168.1.10 , 192.168.1 is the network, 10 is the host

CIDR notation- It determines the number of 1 in the subnet mask. 255.255.255.0 has 24 '1s', hence the IP address can be written as 192.168.1.10/24

PUBLIC VS PRIVATE SUBNET
It can also be divided into public subnet and private subnet
Security: You can isolate different types of resources (e.g., web servers in public subnets and databases in private subnets).
Organization: Subnets help you logically organize your resources within a VPC.
Control: Subnetting allows finer control over traffic flow, both within the VPC and between the VPC and external networks.


ROUTING IN VPC 
-It refers to the process of determining how the network flows inside vpc, to the internet or any other vpc.
-A route table is a set of rules, called routes that determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in a vpc is associate with a route table. A VPC already comes with a main route table
- Routing table consists of destination and target. Destination can be anywhere or a particular ip address. 
-Internet gateway- public subnet needs access to internet

REMOTE WORKERS- CLIENT VPN ENDPOINT
It is a key component of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) designed to allow remote workers to securely connect to an organization's internal resources (such as applications, databases, and file servers) over the internet. It essentially acts as the gateway for remote devices, ensuring secure, encrypted communication between remote clients and the corporate network.
Client VPN Endpoint-
This is a managed VPN server provided by AWS (or another provider) that enables users to connect securely to the network.
It provides encrypted connection using TLS

CORPORATE DATA CENTRE CONNECTION-VIRTUAL GATEWAY(VGW)
It refers to the network component used to securely connect an organization's on-premises data center (corporate data center) to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. The VGW is crucial for hybrid cloud architectures, where businesses need their on-premises resources to communicate with cloud resources seamlessly.
There are two primary ways to establish such connections:
-Site-to-Site VPN: Secure, encrypted connection over the internet.
-AWS Direct Connect: Dedicated physical connection providing higher bandwidth and lower latency than a VPN.

VPC PEERING
It is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that enables communication between them as if they were part of the same network. This connection allows the VPCs to exchange traffic using private IP addresses, without going through the public internet or VPN, making it secure and cost-effective.

AWS Transit Gateway is a highly scalable and central network hub service that connects multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and even other AWS accounts. It simplifies network management by acting as a central router that enables transitive routing between your VPCs and on-premises environments without requiring multiple VPC peering connections.


VPC Endpoints in AWS allow you to privately connect your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect. There are two types
-VPC Endpoint(Gateway): Gateway Endpoints provide private access to certain AWS services by adding an entry to your VPC route table, allowing traffic to be routed to the service through a gateway endpoint. Supported services are S3 and DynamoDB
-VPC Endpoint(Interface): Interface Endpoints create an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in a specific VPC subnet, allowing you to access many AWS services (not limited to S3 or DynamoDB) privately via private IP addresses

Internet Gateway- To allow public traffic from internet to access VPC, you attach an IGW to the VPC

Virtual Private Gateway is used to access private resources of a VPC

Network Access Control Lists(ACL)- It is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic associated with specific IP at subnet level. It is stateless.

SECURITY GROUPS- For additional security EC2 instances have Security Groups. It is stateful

SUBNET
A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private. 

SITE-TO-SITE VPN
It connect on-premises network with VPC in cloud.


Interview Questions

Core Networking Concepts

1. Basics of Networking  
Q.1a What is an IP address, and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
ipv4 is 32 bit with dotted decimal format and four segments while ipv6 is 128 bit hexadecimal format separated by colon with 8 segments. ipv6 provides more unique ip addresses and has added security and also adds routing efficiency

Q.1b Explain the OSI model and its layers.
The Open System Interconnection model is a conceptual framework that conceptualizes the functioning of a telecom or network system in 7 distinct layers
a. Physical- transmission of binary data over physical aspect of network
b. Data link- divides data into frames and manages mac address. Eg: wifi, switches
c. Network- determines best path for data to reach its destination using IP addressing eg: internet protocol ipv4 and ipv6
d. Transport- Manages data segmentation, flow correction and error detection eg: TCP and UDP
e. Session- Manages sessions between application on different devices
f. Presentation- Handles data encryption, compression and translation eg: SSL/TLS encryption
g. Application- Acts as interface between user and network eg: http, dns

Q. 1c How do TCP and UDP differ, and when would you use each?
They are the two primary protocols used for transporting data over network. Both operate at Transport Layer 4 of the OSI model
TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)-used for highly reliable and accurate applications where minor delays are acceptable. It requires handshake before transmitting. eg: webpages http/https, email SMTP, remote sessions. 
UDP(User datagram protocol)-used where speed and efficiency are prioritized over reliability eg: streaming services, online gaming

2. Subnets and CIDR  
Q. 2a What is a subnet, and why do we use it?
A subnet (short for subnetwork) is a segmented part of a larger network, specifically designed to organize and partition IP addresses within a network. 
Improved network organization and scalability
Enhanced security
Optimized network performance
Efficient IP address management
eg: public subnet for webpage and private subnet for database servers

Q. 2b Explain CIDR notation. How would you calculate the range of IPs in a given CIDR block?
-CIDR notation is a way to represent an IP address and its associated network mask compactly, using a slash (/) followed by a number. The number indicates how many bits of the IP address are used for the network portion. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 means the first 24 bits are for the network address, leaving the remaining 8 bits for host addresses

CIDR: CIDR notation is a way to represent an IP address and its associated network mask in a concise format using a slash. eg: 192.	
The total number of IP addresses in a CIDR block can be calculated as 2^(32 - prefix length). eg: /24 will have 2^(32-24)=2^8=256 ip addresses
The first IP address is reserved for network and the last for broadcast.

In summary: To calculate the IP range, you need to identify the network address (the base IP), the broadcast address (the highest IP in the range), and the total number of IP addresses based on the CIDR prefix. 




Q. 2c How would you design subnets for a highly available application across multiple availability zones?
Minimum two availability zones are required for a highly available application. 
Public and private subnets in both the AZ1 and AZ2.
Attach a route table that direct to Internet gateway for public subnet
Attach a route table with a default routing towards a NAT gateway in corresponding public subnet so that private subnet has outbound internet access
Deploy application Load balancer
Configure security group and ACL

1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)  

Q. 1a What is a VPC, and why is it essential in AWS?
A Virtual Private Cloud is an isolated, customizable network within AWS that enable you to launch resources in a virtual network. It is like having a private network in the cloud.
Enhanced security
Customizable network configuration like complete control over ip ranges, subnetting and routing
High availability 
Hybrid cloud connectivity with on premises resources through VPN or AWS Direct Connect
Scalability and flexibility
Compliance and regulatory

Q. 1b How would you set up a secure VPC, and what components are involved?
select vpc cidr block
create private and public subnet in multiple AZ for high availability
Attach internet gateway for internet access in public subnet
Create a NAt gateway for outbound internet access by private subnet
Setup route tables
Implement security group at instance level
Setup NACL(network access control list)
Use VPC endpoints for private connection to AWS services like S3, DynamoDB
Enable flow logs for monitoring

Q. 1c Explain the purpose of route tables, internet gateways, and NAT gateways within a VPC.

2. Security Groups and Network ACLs

Q. 2a What is the difference between a security group and a network ACL?
Both are used to control the flow of inbound and outbound traffic
SG works at instance level and NACL works at subnet level
SG is stateful means if inbound is allowed then outbound rule is also created the same
NACL is stateless means rules for inbound and outbound needs to be created separately
SG permits only "allow" rule while NACL permits both "allow" and "deny" rule

Q. 2b How would you restrict access to an EC2 instance using a security group?
TCP 22 from your ip
TCP 80 http from all or or restrict to specific ip's
TCP 443 https from all or restrict to specific ip's

Q. 2c How do you prioritize rules in security groups versus network ACLs?
In AWS, security groups and network ACLs prioritize rules differently. Security groups evaluate all rules associated with an instance before deciding whether to allow traffic, while network ACLs evaluate rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule. Lower-numbered ACL rules have higher priority

3. VPC Peering and Transit Gateway  
What is VPC peering, and when would you use it?
How does Transit Gateway differ from VPC peering, and what are the benefits of using it?

-VPC peering and Transit Gateway are both AWS networking solutions for connecting VPCs, but they serve different purposes and scales. VPC peering connects two VPCs directly, suitable for smaller, simpler networks. Transit Gateway provides a centralized hub for connecting many VPCs, regions, and on-premises networks, ideal for large, complex architectures.
Transit Gateway provides centralized management, scalability, cost effectiveness and transitive routing

4. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)  
What is the purpose of an Elastic Load Balancer in AWS?
How does ELB distribute traffic across multiple instances?
Explain the differences between Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Classic Load Balancer.


-Application LB: Designed for http/https traffic and ideal for modern web apps
Network LB: Designed for TCP/UDP traffic and ideal for apps that require direct ip-level routing

5. Direct Connect and VPN  
What are the differences between AWS Direct Connect and a Site-to-Site VPN?
When would you choose Direct Connect over VPN?
How would you set up a Site-to-Site VPN connection to AWS?

-AWS Direct Connect and Site-to-Site VPN are both ways to connect your on-premises network to your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), but they differ significantly in terms of connection type, performance, and security. Direct Connect provides a dedicated, private connection, while Site-to-Site VPN uses the public internet and IPsec encryption. Direct Connect is generally preferred for high-bandwidth, low-latency, and more secure connections, while VPN is suitable for cost-effective, easy-to-set-up connections, especially for smaller workloads or when the public internet is acceptable

6. Route 53  
What is Amazon Route 53, and how does it manage DNS?
