DOCKER

Dockerfile: It is a file containing instructions used to build a Docker image using the "Docker Build" command

Docker Run: It is a command used to create containers from Docker image

























KUBERNETES

1. Control Plane/Master

2. Data Plane/Worker:
- Container Runtime
- Kubeproxy
- Kubelet


-> Deployment Manifest: It manages and scales a set of identical pods ensuring that your application remains available and can be updated or rolled back.
It usually contains the following items
- name of deployment object
- number of pods/replicas
- labels applied to pods
- name of the container
- name of the images to be pulled
- imagePullPolicy
- ports

-> Typical Deployment YAML file
1. apiVersion: Kubernetes API version
2. kind: kind of resource eg: deployment, service
3. metadata: provides metadata for deployment eg: names, labels
4. spec: it will have 

-> Service Manifest: Provides a stable IP address and DNS name for accessing your application
It generally contains
- Type of service (nodeport, clusterip, loadbalancer)
- label of the pods from deployment manifests
- ports



* Image pull policy: It determines whether kubelet pulls image from registry. There are 3 main options
1. Always: Will always pull image from registry. These ensures that containers always run latest version of image
2. IfNotPresent: Will only pull image from registry if does not exist locally
3. Never: Never pulls image 

* Deployment object: It is a high level abstraction used to manage and scale identical pods, essentially orchestrating the lifecycle of pods

* Types of services:
1. ClusterIP: Default service if nothing specified, assigns IP address within cluster making the service accessible only from within the cluster
2. Nodeport: Exposes service on specific port on each nodes IP address. Easier than load balancer
3. Load balancer: uses external load balancer from cloud provider


Commands:
- kubectl apply -f deployment/service.yaml
- kubectl get services/deployments/pods
- kubectl delete deployment <app-name> or kubectl delete -f <filename.yaml>
