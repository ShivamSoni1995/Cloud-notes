NETWORKING COMMANDS

1. Ping: It is a primary tool for diagnosing network connectivity issues and check if a remote host is online. It tests network connectivity, measures latency and troubleshoots network
2. Netstat: It is used to view active connections, monitor network interface statistics, checking listening ports, displaying routing tables and identifying open sockets.
3. ifconfig: The ifconfig (interface configuration) command in Linux is used to configure, manage, and retrieve information about network interfaces. It is largely replaced by the ip command
4. traceroute vs tracepath: Traceroute command is used to map the route data packets take to a destination, providing detailed information about each hop. Tracepath is a similar command but does not require any superuser privileges. Traceroute is used for detailed analysis.
5. mtr: It is a powerful diagnostic tool that combines the functionalities of ping and traceroute. It gives a real time analysis about the ip adress and % of packets lost on each hop
6. nslookup- It is a tool used for querying DNS to obtain information about doamin names, ip addresses and other dns records like resolve domain names to ip address and vice versa
7. Telnet- It is a command used to connect to remote servers and systems over the telnet protocol. It is used to test network connectivity, troubleshoot services and for remote adminnistration.
